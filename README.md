This repository is for a website accompanying the release of ByeLingual game engine which is being made for my Games Course at Metropolia University.

C# .Net
Unity engine
React
Django
API design (REST)
Responsive Web design (Bootstrap)
git
Trello
SCRUM
Storyboarding
SQL
Authentication
Multitier app structure
Test-driven development in C# using NUnit and ReSharper

The C# / Unity repository is here: https://github.com/vedran-brnjetic/Byelingual/
